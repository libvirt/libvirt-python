Libvirt Python Binding README
=============================

This package provides a python binding to the libvirt.so,
libvirt-qemu.so and libvirt-lxc.so library APIs.

It is written to build against any version of libvirt that
is 0.9.11 or newer.

This code is distributed under the terms of the LGPL version
2 or later.

Requirements
------------

To build the libvirt python binary requires the GCC and pkg-config
tools, and development headers for the libvirt and python libraries.

Building and installing
-----------------------

The module can be built by following the normal python module
build process

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

or to install as non-root

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install --user

If python-pytest is installed, you can test the package with

  python setup.py test

A makefile shim is provided so that you can do

  make && make check

rather than directly invoking setup.py.

As of libvirt 1.2.6, it is possible to develop against an uninstalled
libvirt.git checkout, by setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variables to point into that libvirt tree; you can even
automate this by using libvirt's run script:

  /path/to/libvirt/run python setup.py build

Patches for this code should be submitted as merge requests to the
project page on gitlab. See CONTRIBUTING.rst for more information.
